# TV News Archives

This is a personal project I'm doing after stumbling upon the [Vanderbilt Television News Archive](https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/). The organization has over a million records (actual recordings) of news reports, but it also includes abstracts of regular evening newscasts for free on its website. I became curious about whether I could efficiently scrape their site for the text abstracts and mine insights from the data (e.g., tracking how screentime for a certain reporter changes over time, how many times Anderson Cooper has reported from somewhere other than the network studio, or comparing the overall topics of broadcasts across networks).

So far I've scraped the text abstracts for all of 2018, and I'm working on cleaning my notebooks up and making them public, along with cleaning/standardizing the data and visualizing some of my EDA findings.
